## About my process

I've used Next.js so that I could mock the handed json files as api calls. These are called [API routes in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). Typescript was added so that I could practice my recentlty acquired skill in this topic. I also added [React toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) for giving some feedback to the user once an employee runs out of vacations days.
